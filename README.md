# orb DID Method

Orb implements the following specifications: [did:orb](https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/),
[Activity Anchors](https://trustbloc.github.io/activityanchors/). The did:orb method is based on the
[Sidetree](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/) specification and Activity Anchors is based on the
[ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) and [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/)
specifications.

Please see [Read the Docs](https://trustbloc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/orb/index.html)
for more details on Orb.

## Build

The project is built using _make_. The BDD test suite can be run with `make bdd-test`. This command builds the Orb images and runs the
integration tests.

## Run

To run Orb outside of _make_, you can use _docker-compose_:

1. `cd test/bdd/fixtures/`
2. `docker-compose up`
This starts the Orb nodes and all dependent containers (wait for containers to start for about 15-20 seconds)

## Tests

A full set of integration tests is included, which demonstrate all the features of Orb, including adding followers/witnesses and
creating/resolving sample DIDs. (These are located in ./test/bdd/features.)

### Prerequisites

* [MongoDB Tools](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/installation/installation), used by the _orb_domain_backup_and_restore_ test
* The PostgreSQL Command Line Tools, which can be installed using the [PostgreSQL installer](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). Note that you can install just them standalone without the PostgreSQL server, which isn't required since PostgreSQL is run via Docker for the BDD tests. The PostgreSQL Command Line Tools are used by the _vct_backup_and_restore_ test.
* The PostgreSQL Command Line Tools added to your PATH.
* The following entries in your `hosts` file: `127.0.0.1 orb.domain1.com` and '127.0.0.1 orb.vct'

### Running BDD tests

After Orb is started (using the instructions in the [Run](#run) section, above) you may run the tests as follows:
1. `cd test/bdd`
2. `DISABLE_COMPOSITION=true go test`


You can run individual tests using the -run option, for example:

`DISABLE_COMPOSITION=true go test -run concurrent_requests_scenario`

After the tests have run, you may resolve a DID by hitting the endpoint: https://localhost:48326/sidetree/v1/identifiers/{did}, where {did}
can be chosen from the variety of DIDs in the BDD test console output. It will look like this: did:orb:EiBQyuTmdDYoVWD1GgmM1lLG5wY_9zZNzC0DE-VY3Ska2Q.

You can hit various REST endpoints to discover information about Orb. For example:

- Domain's public key: `https://localhost:48326/.well-known/did.json`
- Discovery configuration: `https://localhost:48326/.well-known/did-orb`

(A complete list of endpoints is documented [here](https://trustbloc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/orb/restendpoints/index.html).)

To bring everything down run `docker-compose down`

## Configuration

To get help about startup options use the following command (don't forget to build Orb (`make orb`) before starting it):

```$ ./.build/bin/orb start -h```

The output should be similar to this:

```
Start orb-server

Usage:
  orb-server start [flags]

Flags:
  -P, --activitypub-page-size string                         The maximum page size for an ActivityPub collection or ordered collection. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: ACTIVITYPUB_PAGE_SIZE
  -o, --allowed-origins stringArray                          Allowed origins for this did method. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: ALLOWED_ORIGINS
  -d, --anchor-credential-domain string                      Anchor credential domain (required). Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: ANCHOR_CREDENTIAL_DOMAIN
      --anchor-data-uri-media-type string                    The media type for data URIs in an anchor Linkset. Possible values are 'application/json' and 'application/gzip;base64'. If 'application/json' is specified then the content of the data URIs in the anchor LInkset are encoded as an escaped JSON string. If 'application/gzip;base64' is specified then the content is compressed with gzip and base64 encoded (default is 'application/gzip;base64').Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: ANCHOR_DATA_URI_MEDIA_TYPE
      --anchor-status-in-process-grace-period string         The period in which witnesses will not be re-selected for 'in-process' anchors.Defaults to 1m if not set. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: ANCHOR_STATUS_IN_PROCESS_GRACE_PERIOD
      --anchor-status-monitoring-interval string             The interval in which 'in-process' anchors are monitored to ensure that they will be witnessed(completed) as per policy.Defaults to 5s if not set. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: ANCHOR_STATUS_MONITORING_INTERVAL
      --apclient-cache-Expiration string                     The expiration time of an ActivityPub service and public key cache. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: ACTIVITYPUB_CLIENT_CACHE_EXPIRATION
      .
      .
      .
```

A complete list of required and optional parameters is documented
[here](https://trustbloc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/orb/parameters.html#startup-parameters).

The minimal configuration to run a service is:

```./.build/bin/orb start --host-url="0.0.0.0:7890" --cas-type=local --external-endpoint=http://localhost:7890 --did-namespace=test --database-type=mem --kms-secrets-database-type=mem --anchor-credential-domain=http://localhost:7890```

## Databases

The following databases are supported:
* MongoDB
* CouchDB
* Memory (the in-memory database should only be used for demos)
